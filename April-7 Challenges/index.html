      Challenge 1<br />
      Given a standard English sentence passed in as a string, <br />
      write a method that will return a sentence made up of the same words,
      <br />
      but sorted by their first letter. However, the method of sorting has a
      twist to it:<br />
      All words that begin with a lower case letter should be at the beginning
      of the <br />
      sorted sentence, and sorted in ascending order.<br />
      All words that begin with an upper case letter should come after that,<br />
      and should be sorted in descending order.<br />
      If a word appears multiple times in the sentence, it should be returned
      multiple times in the sorted sentence. <br />
      Any punctuation must be discarded.<br /><br />

      Example:<br />

      sentenceSort("Hello my name is Forest and I love love love to code!") ==>
      'and code is love love love name my to Forest Hello I'<br /><br />

      Challenge 2 <br />
      You are tasked with creating a tournament function. <br />
      The input of this function will be an array of contestant's ranks (as
      numbers). <br />
      You must eliminate contestant in series of rounds comparing consecutive
      <br />
      pairs of ranks and store all initial and intermediate results in an
      array.<br />

      During one round, the lowest rank of a pair is eliminated while the
      highest proceeds to the next round. <br />
      This goes on until one contestant only is left. If the number of
      contestants is odd, <br />
      the last one of the current array becomes the first of the next round.<br />

      At the end of the competition, return the results of all the rounds in the
      form of an array of arrays.<br /><br />

      Example:<br />

      var contestants = [9,5,4,7,6,3,8,2]<br /><br />

      tournament(contestants) ==> <br />
      [ <br />
      [9,5,4,7,6,3,8,2],<br />
      [9,7,6,8],<br />
      [9,8],<br />
      [9] <br />
      ]<br />
